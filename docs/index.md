# Engineering Notes

> "The best systems are boring."

Welcome to my personal knowledge base. This site documents **production-grade patterns**, **trade-offs**, and **system designs** for building scalable software and AI systems.

The goal is to move beyond surface-level tutorials and codify the "Context-as-Code" required to steer autonomous agents.

## 🧠 Agentic AI & SDLC

Standardizing how we build software with AI agents.

- **[AI SDLC](notes/ai-sdlc.md)**: A framework for **Context-as-Code** (`.cursor/rules`, Skills, PRDs) and **MCP** integration to build consistent, high-quality software with agents.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Systems

Productionalizing ML models is harder than training them.

- **[MLflow on Cloud Run](notes/mlflow-cloud-run.md)**: Serverless architecture for ML metadata and model registry.
- **[ONNX Java Serving](notes/onnx-java-serving.md)**: High-performance CPU & GPU inference in Java environments.

## 🛠️ Developer Experience

Tools and patterns for efficiency.

- **[Cloud Cheatsheet](notes/cloud-cheatsheet.md)**: CLI references for AWS/GCP/Azure.
- **[Zsh Setup](notes/zsh-setup.md)**: A blazingly fast terminal environment (Powerlevel10k, SDKMAN).
