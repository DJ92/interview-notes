# Engineering Notes

Welcome to my personal knowledge base. This site serves as a collection of notes, cheatsheets, and deep dives into **Machine Learning Systems**, **Applied GenAI**, and **Software Engineering** patterns.

The goal is to move beyond surface-level tutorials and document production-grade patterns, trade-offs, and system designs.

## 📚 Key Sections

### [Machine Learning Systems](notes/mlflow-cloud-run.md)
Productionalizing ML models is harder than training them.
- **[MLflow on Cloud Run](notes/mlflow-cloud-run.md)**: A serverless, scalable architecture for ML metadata and model registry.

### [Cheatsheets](notes/cloud-cheatsheet.md)
Quick references for frequent tasks.
- **[Cloud Cheatsheet](notes/cloud-cheatsheet.md)**: Common CLI commands and patterns for major cloud providers.
