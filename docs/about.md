# About Me

I am a Staff Systems & Machine Learning Engineer specializing in **large-scale personalization, ranking, and ML platforms**. Also, working on agentic AI systems and research on open source LLMs.

Currently, I design and build systems that serve millions of users, focusing on the intersection of theoretical modeling and practical engineering constraints.

## Technical Focus

### 🏗 Systems Engineering
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Designing low-latency inference systems.
*   **Data Infrastructure**: Building robust pipelines for training and real-time serving.
*   **MLOps**: Automating model lifecycle from research to production.

### 🧠 Applied Machine Learning
*   **Recommender Systems**: Deep learning for collaborative filtering and ranking (Two-Tower, DLRM).
*   **Natural Language Processing**: LLM orchestration and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
*   **Optimization**: Multi-objective optimization for balancing engagement and business metrics.

## Philosophy

> "The best systems are boring."

I believe in simple, predictable, and observable systems. Complexity should be introduced only when necessary to solve a specific problem, not for its own sake.
