I am a Staff Systems & Machine Learning Engineer specializing in **large-scale personalization, ranking, and ML platforms**. Also, working on agentic AI systems and research on open source LLMs.

Currently, I design and build systems that serve millions of users, focusing on the intersection of theoretical modeling and practical engineering constraints.

## Technical Focus

### 🏗 Systems Engineering
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Designing low-latency inference systems.
*   **Data Infrastructure**: Building robust pipelines for training and real-time serving.
*   **MLOps**: Automating model lifecycle from research to production.

### 🧠 Applied Machine Learning
*   **Recommender Systems**: Deep learning for collaborative filtering and ranking (Two-Tower, DLRM).
*   **Natural Language Processing**: LLM orchestration and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
*   **Optimization**: Multi-objective optimization for balancing engagement and business metrics.

### 🤖 Agentic AI Systems
*   **LLM Agents**: Building autonomous agents for complex tasks.
*   **Open Source LLMs**: Research and development of open source LLMs.
*   **AI SDLC**: Standardizing AI Software Development Lifecycle.

## Philosophy

> "Learn, build, share."
>
> "The best systems are boring."
>
> "Leave the codebase better than you found it."
>
> "Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard."

I believe in simple, predictable, and observable systems. Complexity should be introduced only when necessary to solve a specific problem, not for its own sake.
